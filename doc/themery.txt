Themery is a plugin for Neovim written in Lua which allows you to quickly
switch between your installed themes through a menu and making them persistent
like VSCode. Very convenient.

MOTIVATION                                                *themery-motivation*

In most text editors there is usually an option to change the colorscheme
quickly. This is very useful for adapting if you work in daylight or at night,
if you have to make a presentation on a projector or simply because you like to
change often.

In vim there is no "efficient" way to change them;

1. You can change it in the configuration file but that involves opening and editing it.
2. You can use `:colorscheme <theme>` but it is temporary and sometimes you need to run some more command to apply the theme to other plugins or set some variables.

Themery adds to your neovim a menu from which you can switch between all of
them simply and quickly.


USAGE                                                          *themery-usage*

Open with `:Themery` and navigate and move between the results with `j` and
`k`.

Press `<cr>` for apply theme and save. `q` or `<Esc>` for exit without
applying.


INSTALLATION                                            *themery-installation*

Choose one of these options and continue with "Configuration".


VIM-PLUG ~

>
    Plug 'zaldih/themery.nvim'
<


PACKER ~

>
    use 'zaldih/themery.nvim'
<


CONFIGURATION                                          *themery-configuration*

Configuration is simple and intuitive.


MINIMAL CONFIG

Let‚Äôs get down to the nitty-gritty first. Anywhere in your configuration put
this:

>lua
    -- Minimal config
    require("themery").setup({
      themes = {"gruvbox", "ayu", ...}, -- Your list of installed colorschemes.
      livePreview = true, -- Apply theme while picking. Default to true.
    })
<

Thats is all! When you open Themery you will see the above **themes** list.


CUSTOMIZING NAMES

Let‚Äôs see how we can customise the list a bit‚Ä¶

>lua
    -- Set custom name to the list
    require("themery").setup({
      themes = {{
        name = "Day",
        colorscheme = "kanagawa-lotus",
      },
      {
        name = "Night",
        colorscheme = "kanagawa-dragon",
      }},
    })
<


EXECUTING CODE ON THEME APPLY

Let‚Äôs go one step further.

Sometimes it is necessary to add additional instructions to make your favourite
theme work.

Themery includes a before and after option that will be executed respectively
before applying the theme.

For example, **gruvbox** uses a variable to switch between **light** and
**dark** mode.

>lua
    -- Using before and after.
    require("themery").setup({
      themes = {{
        name = "Gruvbox dark",
        colorscheme = "gruvbox",
        before = [[
          -- All this block will be executed before apply "set colorscheme"
          vim.opt.background = "dark"
        ]],
      },
      {
        name = "Gruvbox light",
        colorscheme = "gruvbox",
        before = [[
          vim.opt.background = "light"
        ]],
        after = [[-- Same as before, but after if you need it]]
      }},
      [...]
    })
<

That is, everything inside those variables will be executed as Lua code.


  [!IMPORTANT] Note that all code in after and before must be declared as a
  string. That is, wrapped between '[[‚Äô and ‚Äô]]' and not as a function.

WIP                                                              *themery-wip*

**Project under development.** Many things can change at any time and the
plugin may not be stable.

**Let me know if you have any suggestions, comments or bugs!**


TO-DO ~

- Add categories (Light/Dark).
- Expose the API to be able to switch between themes without opening the menu.

In the future I would like the plugin to become a complete theme manager so
that themes can be tested on the fly before installing them or browsing through
a community repertoire.
